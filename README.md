## MultiAgent XAI Demo

This demo leverages the `microsoft/phi-4` language model for simulating a conversation between two roles: an Engineer and an Analyst. The goal is to collaboratively address user-provided queries and produce actionable insights.

### Features
- **Engineer Role**: Provides concise, technical solutions.
- **Analyst Role**: Offers data-driven recommendations to complement the Engineer's response.
- **Natural Dialogue**: Facilitates a three-turn conversation between the roles.
- **Actionable Summary**: Generates a final plan summarizing key insights.

### How It Works
1. The user enters a query.
2. The Engineer and Analyst respond alternately, building on each other's inputs.
3. A final summary is generated, integrating technical and analytical perspectives.

### Technology Stack
- **Streamlit**: Interactive web interface.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: Using `pipeline` with the `microsoft/phi-4` model for text generation.
